      "#### Step 1: Initial Access through VM1 by way of exposed SSH\n",
      "- **Rating: 1 (achieved)**\n",
      "- **Reasoning**: The attack path correctly identifies the initial access vector through an exposed SSH port on the VM. It mentions both brute force attacks and exploitation of vulnerabilities as potential methods for gaining access.\n",
      "- **Specific Examples**:\n",
      "  - \"SSH Brute Force Attack: Since the Network Security Group (NSG) allows inbound SSH traffic from any source, an attacker could attempt to brute force the SSH credentials of the VM.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Privilege Escalation\n",
      "- **Rating: 1 (achieved)**\n",
      "- **Reasoning**: The attack path correctly identifies the potential for privilege escalation through the abuse of the managed identity assigned to the VM. It explains how the attacker could leverage this identity to access other Azure resources.\n",

    "### Mitigation Recommendations:\n",
    "- **Restrict SSH Access:** Modify the NSG rules to allow SSH access only from specific IP addresses or ranges.\n",

    "- **Regularly Rotate Credentials:** Rotate SSH keys and service principal secrets regularly.\n",
    "- **Monitor and Audit Logs:** Continuously monitor and audit logs for any suspicious activities.\n",

    "- **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised resource.\n",
