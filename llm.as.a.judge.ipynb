    "\n",
    "    **Steps in attack path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step 1 - Initial Access through VM1 by way of exposed SSH**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The attacker can gain initial access by brute forcing the SSH port of VM1, which allows traffic on port 22 from any source in the internet.\n",
    "    - **Weakness:** Exposed SSH port in the internet, which could lead to a compromise if weak credentials are leveraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step 2 - Privilege Escalation - The attacker compromises the managed identity assigned to VM1**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The attacker identifies the managed identity assigned to the VM and can now leverage it for further abuse. The attacker identifies that the managed identity has the â€œStorage Blob Data Owner\" role on a storage account that can be used for data tampering, deletion, and exfiltration.\n",
    "    - **Weakness:** Over-privileged permission being assigned to a publicly-facing virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step 3 - Data Exfiltration - The attacker exfiltrates data from the storage account**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The attacker leverages the role of the managed identity to exfiltrate data from the storage account.\n",
    "    - **Weakness:** Over-privileged permission being assigned to a publicly-facing virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step 4 - Lateral Movement - Virtual Network Lateral Movement**\n",
    "    - **Description:** Although no resources could be identified within the virtual network, the attacker can now reach any endpoint within the virtual network and, potentially, perform lateral movement.\n",
    "    - **Weakness:** Lack of networking segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Evaluation Criteria:**\n",
    "    1. Clarity of the attack path explanation for each step.\n",
    "    2. Comprehensiveness of the attack scenarios, ensuring all steps are covered.\n",
    "    3. Realism of the attack scenarios in reflecting real-world threats.\n",
    "    4. Identification of key security weaknesses in each step.\n",
    "    5. Suggested mitigations and recommendations for each identified weakness.\n",
    "    6. Understanding of security concepts demonstrated in the explanation.\n",
